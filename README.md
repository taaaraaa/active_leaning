# Active Learning
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a usefull example to get started with implementing active learning using Python. This repository contains the Titanic dataset.
## What is Active Learning?
Active learning is mostly used when there is a shortage of labelled data. It is a technique in machine learning where the algorithm iteratively selects the most informative samples to be labelled by an oracle, such as a human expert. The labelled samples are then used to retrain the model and improve its accuracy.

## Requirements: 

You will need to install python and import the following libraries to use this code:
- Pandas
- Numpy


## Setup: 
To get started with active learning using these codes, you need to:
- Download the Titanic dataset
- Install python and import necessary libarires
- run the Python code
