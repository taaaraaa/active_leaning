# Active Learning
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a usefull example to get started with implementing active learning using Python. This repository contains the Titanic dataset.
## What is Active Learning?
Active learning is a technique in machine learning where the algorithm iteratively selects the most informative samples to be labelled by an oracle, such as a human expert. The labelled samples are then used to retrain the model and improve its accuracy.

:bulb: **Tip:** To learn more about Active Learning, you can follow [this link](https://medium.com/@farhadi.tahere/leverage-your-data-science-skills-with-active-learning-in-python-fbcaefc2350c) on medium. It is an article written by me.

## Requirements: 

You will need to install python and import the following libraries to use this code:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn

## Setup: 
To get started with active learning using these codes, you need to:
- Download the Titanic dataset
- Install python and import necessary libarires
- run the Python code


## Dataset
Titanic Dataset. This dataset is clean (other than missing values!) so in this example, you won't need to do EDA!
